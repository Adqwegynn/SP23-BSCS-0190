Note: Here I got a problem because when I was running the code then the CV pdf format was not supporting all sizes of CV and the assistant was also not there then I updated with the next prompt 

Prompt 4:
look it is not uploading and I want all sizes of CV can be uploaded on my website by the candidate and he should be able to have a marking based on the compatibility of low / medium / high by our AI model

note: there I faced a problem Cuz the Claude API was not there and website was searching for claude api after the upload of CV


Prompt 5: 
Give an API for my project I want it to be HR related and also I wana have the chatbot 

Note: this was asking me to get API key from GPT 5 that would be from some penny then I asked it do it for free for me 

Prompt 6:
I wana do it cost free without any penny

Note : There I found a way to get my chatbot to be integrated on my website but the chatbot was not fully trained fot that and I was still facing trouble with my upload of CV
Note : Then I started my face 2 

FACE 2 : 

Prompt 1 :
hi claude so this is my second time am using claude I had some difficulties with my project right now and it is not working fine with i and could you please tell me what should I do if will provide you my codes

Prompt 2 :
I wana have an AI chat bot and I wana do it in a way that my AI will tell the candidate either he is eligible fir the job description or not I want the same functionality as Linkedin but I wana have it for the short circle of people and also I wana have in a way that AI assistant will be there for a candidate to assist him or her regarding to the job description and their CV

Prompt 3: 
but in this chatbot is not working and candidate portal is also not working I want you make it work for the candidiates and the company as well for the enhancment of the project and also give me the code and make it professional

Note: there calude gave me 2 files of chatbot-style.css and chatbot-app.js

Prompt 4: 
does the java files will remain same ? or you are going to change something?

Note : after the implementation I ran in one more problem my website was only showing the html output the java and CSS were not working and the Chatbot button was also removed 

Note : after that I asked claude to fix that for me then Claude made it in a way that the chatbot was popping on the screen but candidate was unable to upload the CV the chatbot was popping in and the marking was also not working at that time I decided to remove the chatbbot and made it simple without an AI integration cuz we were asked for an Ai virtual assistant that will provide a candidate a score level based on their CV and the Job description they are aplying

Prompt 5:
I have asked you to make it like a candidate can upload his CV on to the desired JOB post and then he can see the ratings after that and after that AI chatbot will popup so that the candidate can get a help from AI chatbot

FACE 3:

Prompt 1:
I need a virtual assistant what should I do I want the candidate to upload his CV and a viirtual assistant will tell his score according to the job description now I am giving you a instruction according to that you have to make it ... 
Design an HR assistant that helps a recruiter quickly see how well a candidate’s CV matches a specific advertised job. The system should accept a CV and a Job Description (JD), extract key elements such as skills, experience, and qualifications, and compute a simple match indication (for example, a percentage score or Low/Medium/High). It should also highlight the main reasons for this assessment, such as strong overlaps or missing key skills. Design a minimal tool that can support a recruiter’s initial screening and help candidates understand how well they fit in a role. 

Note: You are pleased to give me all the possible codes for this project and also you are pleased to make it in a way that candidiate can upload his or her CV in the form of PDF or a Word file

Prompt 2:
give me line by line like first you are asked to give first index.html file style.css file, node.js file I wnat to break em and give that that would work for me like this You are asked to give me all of the codes but by breaking them in parts like index.html file will have html code style.css file will have css and all of the styling code...

Note: The project that is now created has not fully secured and does not has any privacy thats why I has to modify my current project and has to create some security for it 


FACE 4:

Prompt 1: 
I am providing you the project and u are asked to make it secure for an individual and also u r asked to keep it private in concerns of data

Note: there Claude provided me a modified file of app.js with contains secure and privacy Concerns..
