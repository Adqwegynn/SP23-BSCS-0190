HR Virtual Assistant - CV Matching System

HR teams need a fast, accurate, affordable, and privacy-respecting way to match CVs with job requirements while providing transparency to candidates...

=======================================================================

Problem Faced while making the Project:

While testing the website I ran in a problem there I got a problem because when I was running the code then the CV pdf format was not supporting all sizes of CV and the assistant was also not there then I updated with the next prompt..

there I faced a problem Cuz the Claude API was not there and website was searching for claude api after the upload of CV

this was asking me to get API key from GPT 5 that would be from some penny then I asked it do it for free for me 

There I found a way to get my chatbot to be integrated on my website but the chatbot was not fully trained fot that and I was still facing trouble with my upload of CV
Note : Then I started my face 2 

there calude gave me 2 files of chatbot-style.css and chatbot-app.js

after the implementation I ran in one more problem my website was only showing the html output the java and CSS were not working and the Chatbot button was also removed 

after that I asked claude to fix that for me then Claude made it in a way that the chatbot was popping on the screen but candidate was unable to upload the CV the chatbot was popping in and the marking was also not working at that time I decided to remove the chatbbot and made it simple without an AI integration cuz we were asked for an Ai virtual assistant that will provide a candidate a score level based on their CV and the Job description they are aplying..

The project that is now created has not fully secured and does not has any privacy thats why I has to modify my current project and has to create some security for it...

there Claude provided me a modified file of app.js with contains secure and privacy Concerns..

// Now We Will be doscussing the main problems 

1. Time-Consuming Manual Screening:

HR professionals spend hours manually reading CVs
Average time per CV: 5-10 minutes
For 100 applications = 8-16 hours of work
Leads to recruitment delays and missed opportunities...

2. Inconsistent Evaluation:

Different recruiters have different standards
Subjective bias affects candidate selection
Human error causes qualified candidates to be overlooked
No standardized scoring system... 

3. Lack of Transparency

Candidates don't know why they were rejected
No clear feedback on skill gaps
Difficult to understand what to improve
Black box decision-making process...

4. Privacy & Security Concerns
Sensitive CV data sent to external APIs
Data breaches risk personal information

Pain Points:

Overwhelmed by Volume:
Receive 100+ applications per job posting
Can't review all CVs thoroughly
